# Akita::HarLogger

Rack middleware for logging HTTP requestâ€“response pairs to a HAR file.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'akita-har_logger'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install akita-har_logger

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
